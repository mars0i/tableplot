;; # Preface

 "
Hanamicloth is a composition of
[Hanami](https://github.com/jsa-aerial/hanami) data visualization [templates](https://github.com/jsa-aerial/hanami?tab=readme-ov-file#templates-substitution-keys-and-transformations)
and [Tablecloth](https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/) datasets.

It adds a simplified set of Hanami templates and defaults alongside those of Hanami,
as well as a set of template-processing functions
inspired by [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)'s
[layered grammar of graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html).

The current draft was written by Daniel Slutsky,
mentored by jsa-aerial (Hanami author) and Kira McLean.

**Artifact:** [![(Clojars coordinates)](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.scicloj/hanamicloth.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.scicloj/hanamicloth)

**Status:** The `api` namespace will soon move to beta stage, but still lacks some important features. The `plotlycloth` namespace is still experimental.

-------------------

An early version of this library was demonstrated in Kira Mclean's
April 2024 talk at London Clojurians:

## Two APIs

Hanamicloth currently supports two APIs:

- `scicloj.hanamicloth.v1.api` generates [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) plots.

- `scicloj.hanamicloth.v1.plotlycloth` generates the [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) plots.

Each of these APIs builds upon the strengths of its target platform and partially uses its naming and concepts. Thus, the two APIs are not completely compatible. The Plotly-based API is expected to grow a little further in terms of its flexibility and the kinds of idioms it can express. ")

(md "

## Near term plan
- Stabilize both the Vega-Lite-based API and the Plotly.js-based API as Beta stage.
- Keep developing main ly the Plotly.js-based API (as it will be more flexible to extend).

## Goals

- Have a functional grammar for common plotting tasks (but not all tasks).
- In particular, provide an easy way to work with layers.
- Be able to pass Tablecloth/tech.ml.dataset datasets directly to the plotting functions.
- Work out-of-the box in Kindly-supporting tools.
- By default, infer relevant information from the data (e.g., field types).
- Catch common errors using the data (e.g., missing fields).
- Be able to use backend Clojure for relevant statistical tasks (e.g., smoothing by regression, histograms, density estimation).
- Be able to rely on Vega-Lite/Plotly.js for other some components of the pipeline (e.g., scales and coordinates).
- Provide simpler Hanami templates, compared to the original ones.
- Still have the option of using the original Hanami templates.
- Still be able to use all of Vega-Lite/Plotly.js in its raw format for the highest flexibility.

In the longer term, this project is part of the Scicloj effort to create a grammar-of-graphics visualization library in Clojure.
