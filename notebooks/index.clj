 "
Tableplot is a Clojure library for data visualization 
inspired by [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)'s
[layered grammar of graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html). 

It is built to be composable with [Tablecloth](https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/) table processing
and extend the plotting
[templates](https://github.com/jsa-aerial/hanami?tab=readme-ov-file#templates-substitution-keys-and-transformations)
of [Hanami](https://github.com/jsa-aerial/hanami).

Tableplot works with any tool that supports 
the [Kindly](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly-noted/) data visualization standard,
such as [Clay](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/).

## Three APIs

Tableplot currently supports three APIs:

- `scicloj.tableplot.v1.plotly` generates the [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) plots.

- `scicloj.tableplot.v1.hanami` generates [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) plots and parially composes with the original Hanami templates.

- `scicloj.tableplot.v1.transpile` (experimental) generates specs for various data visualization libraries that may include some Javascript code.

Each of the `plotly` and `hnami` APIs builds upon the strengths of its target platform and partially uses its naming and concepts. Thus, the two APIs are not completely compatible. The Plotly-based API is expected to grow a little further in terms of its flexibility and the kinds of idioms it can express. ")

## Goals

- Have a functional grammar for common plotting tasks (but not all tasks).
- In particular, provide an easy way to work with layers.
- Be able to pass Tablecloth/tech.ml.dataset datasets directly to the plotting functions.
- Work out-of-the box in Kindly-supporting tools.
- By default, infer relevant information from the data (e.g., field types).
- Catch common errors using the data (e.g., missing fields).
- Be able to use backend Clojure for relevant statistical tasks (e.g., smoothing by regression, histograms, density estimation).
- Be able to rely on Vega-Lite/Plotly.js for other some components of the pipeline (e.g., scales and coordinates).
- Provide simple Hanami templates in addition to the original ones.
- Still have the option of using the original Hanami templates.
- Still be able to use all of Vega-Lite/Plotly.js in their raw format for the highest flexibility.

In the longer term, this project is part of the Scicloj effort to create a grammar-of-graphics visualization library in Clojure.
