# Tableplot

Easy layered graphics with Hanami & Tablecloth

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.scicloj/tableplot.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.scicloj/tableplot)

Tableplot is a composition of
[Hanami](https://github.com/jsa-aerial/hanami) data visualization [templates](https://github.com/jsa-aerial/hanami?tab=readme-ov-file#templates-substitution-keys-and-transformations)
and [Tablecloth](https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/) datasets.

It is inspired by [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)'s
[layered grammar of graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html).
