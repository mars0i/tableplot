# Hanamicloth

Easy layered graphics with Hanami & Tablecloth

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.scicloj/hanamicloth.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.scicloj/hanamicloth)

Hanamicloth is a composition of
[Hanami](https://github.com/jsa-aerial/hanami) data visualization [templates](https://github.com/jsa-aerial/hanami?tab=readme-ov-file#templates-substitution-keys-and-transformations)
and [Tablecloth](https://scicloj.github.io/tablecloth/) datasets.

It adds a simplified set of Hanami templates and defaults alongside those of Hanami,
as well as a set of template-processing functions
inspired by [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)'s
[layered grammar of graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html).

A more comprehensive documentation is coming soon.

## Status

The `api` namespace will soon move to beta stage, but still lacks some important features. The `plotlycloth` namespace is still experimental.
User feedback will be appreciated on our path to stabilizing it.

Your feedback is needed at this experimental stage.
